## Skills

#### Courageous with can-do attitude
I am very courageous by nature, and strongly believe that I can achieve anything if I put my mind to it. In our final project at Makers Academy, I chose to build an autonomous car. Not knowing anything about robotics, Python as a language or machine learning; it seemed impossible to achieve in less than two weeks. But it was the sheer courage and can-do attitude that led me and my team and we ended up with something that was never done at Makers Academy. Another example of the same would be forming my own apparel company. I had no idea on where to start or how things work. Again, with some research and positive attitude I dived right in and ended up introducing my own brand of leather jackets.

#### Problem solving and debugging
If there’s one thing I enjoy the most about software development, it’s problem solving. Challenges inspire me the most. Finding solution to a problem by breaking them in little chunks takes away the complexity of the problem and makes it a lot more easier. 
During my time at Makers Academy, I always welcomed anyone asking me to have a look at their code to see if I can help them debug or find a better solution.

#### Team Player and Pair Programming
I am an excellent team player and thrive under pressure. I welcome the diversity that a team has to offer in terms of learning from an individual’s strengths to develop areas where others have weaknesses.
This is achieved by developing good working relationships and sharing of important information through communication, trust and mutual respect for each other. Team meeting and stand ups are the best format for teams to share their knowledge.   
Whilst at Makers, we focused a lot on pair programming/grouping. I found being able to explain my thoughts and processes to another person was an excellent way of solidifying the idea and find flaws in the logic. It also made sure that we produce the best code we can.
